    According to logback docs it SHOULD be possible to call this file logback-test.xml and have
    it found first, but Play overrides some stuff so this is only found by manually setting
    -Dlogger.resource, which we do in the SBT build. Have chosen a different name to make it
    clear that it's not using logback's own mechanism.
